# Particle Swarm Optimization as an Inverse Kinematics Solver 🤖

This repository implements the Particle Swarm Optimization  algorithm aimed at reaching and approximate solution to a 6-DOF manipulator's inverse kinematics problem. 

This algorithm was developed in **R2022a MATLAB**, however it may be easily replicated in languages that have similarities to MATLAB's script language, such as Python.

The particles and the optimization process itself are defined as _classes_, and the main test code is [teste_pso.m](https://github.com/pirgus/pso-ik/blob/main/test_pso.m), in which the classes instantiation may be easier to understand.
