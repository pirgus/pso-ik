# Particle Swarm Optimization as an Inverse Kinematics Solver

This repository implements the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm aimed at reaching and approximate solution to a 6-DOF manipulator's inverse kinematics problem.

This algorithm was developed in **R2022a MATLAB**, however it may be easily replicated in languages that have similarities to MATLAB's script language, such as Python.

The particles and the optimization process itself are defined as _classes_, and the main test code is _teste_pso.m_, in which the classes instantiation may be easier to understand.
